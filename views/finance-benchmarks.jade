					p In 2013, 70 of Australiaâ€™s leading organisation participated. With median revenue of $850 million, median headcount of 1500 employees, and 35% being ASX listed, the 2013 studies provided a good quantity and quality of respondent. The studies allow you to assess:

						li How am I performing against my peers?
						li What are the attributes of a high performing function?
						li What is the optimal headcount for my team?
						li What should the cost of my function be?
						li What are the key trends?

					p The responses provide interesting trends and insights into the way Australian companies are performing, and where their future strategies lie.
